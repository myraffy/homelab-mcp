## Best Practices

### When Starting Work
1. **Check infrastructure status first** - Use relevant MCP tools to understand current state
2. **Query Ansible inventory** - Understand host relationships and groups
3. **Verify services are running** - Use Docker and service-specific MCPs

### When Making Changes
1. **Use MCP Registry Inspector** - Write updated code directly to files
2. **Update Ansible inventory** - Keep it as single source of truth
3. **Test after changes** - Verify with appropriate MCP tools
4. **Document in .md files** - Use write_mcp_file to create documentation

### When Troubleshooting
1. **Start with service-specific MCP** - Check if service is actually down
2. **Check Docker containers** - Verify container health and status
3. **Review network** - Use Unifi MCP to check connectivity
4. **Check DNS** - Pi-hole MCP for DNS issues
5. **Verify Ansible config** - Ensure inventory is correct

### Important Notes
- **Always check before assuming** - Don't assume services are down, verify with MCPs
- **Use Ansible inventory** - It's the source of truth for infrastructure
- **Write files directly** - You can update MCP code using write_mcp_file
- **Test thoroughly** - After making changes, verify with relevant MCP tools
- **Configuration in Ansible** - Host IPs, ports, and infrastructure details live in Ansible inventory
